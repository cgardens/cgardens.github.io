        <div class="statement">
          <p>I associate the values of Challenge, Affection, Family, Achievement, Persistence, and Effectiveness with the moments of greatest satisfaction in my life.</p>

          <p>Challenge is particularly poignant, because it is through tests that I learn and grow most. Making the impossible possible. Testing my limits. I try to engineer everyday to present me with at least one challenge from which I can grow.</p>

          <p>I was last asked for advice on refactoring. I helped my friend breakdown a problem that as a whole seemed challenging but was, in fact, manageable once he broke it down.</p>

          <p>My values drive my sense of the world. They drive my actions, which define who I am. They help me mediate stereotype threat because they enumerate my personal goals so that the expectations of others whether positive or negative no longer matter. Sure, in practice implementation of this philosophy is tricky, but it keeps me on track.</p>

          <p>I think starting everyday by defining my goals and identifying upcoming challenges will give me the context I need to excel at DBC.</p>

          <p>The other ways that I bring myself up when I am feeling low is exercise and shooting zombies in video games. Malaise often has a physical component that needs to be worked out by these more visceral activities so that I can go back and center myself with the aforementioned psychological ones.</p>
