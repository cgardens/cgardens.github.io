        <div id="entrytitle"> </br>Shame and the Ego</div>
        <div id="date"> 11/30/2014 </div>
        <div class="statement">
          <p>While it is all very well to enumerate the defense mechanisms of shame in the &#34;Compass of Shame&#34; and strive towards humility, Grossman&#39;s <a href="http://southdown.on.ca/publications/articles/Compass-of-Shame.pdf">&#34;Compass of Shame&#34;</a> article leaves much to be desired in terms of actionable advice when dealing with real-life shame.</p>

          <p>I will distill shame into two forms: 1) Self-Induced 2) Peer-Induced. While this distillation is incomplete, it should at least take a step towards clarity from Grossman&#39;s insights. Self-Induced: Feeling shame for something that one has done that was unwise, rude or otherwise unseemly, is a valuable feeling that can teach one to act differently in the future based on one&#39;s own standards of what is and is not appropriate. I feel shame for certain things that I have done that nobody else knows about. I try to use these instances as a guide to make me a better person. This type of shame, provided it does not become obsessive, is valuable.</p>

          <p>Peer-Induced Shame is when the group condemns something of you shameful. In this instance, I disagree with Grossman. The solution is not more esoteric &#34;humility.&#34; At this point one must overcome their natural defensive reactions to shame--withdrawal, avoidance, attack self, and attack other--and determine whether based on their own standards of being whether their actions merit shame. If so, then he or she should act to change them. If, however, the values of the group differ from those of the individual, the individual must determine if there is greater value in adhering to the values the group than sticking with his or her own. This choice represents an important ideological compromise, not a deluge of humility.</p>

          <p>Worth mentioning is that peer-induced shame can simply be based in cruelty and not in any impasse of values. In these cases the group for one reason or attempt to shame an individual for actions that may or may not be the same those of the group. These do not contain a valuable behavioral learning process but are a trial in conflict resolution. Either the individual leaves the group or works to find the group&#39;s approval to subvert its cruelty. Humility may well be one tool in this instance, but by no means is it the only or necessarily the most successful. Even then, it is only really applicable in this one subsection of a subsection of shame.</p>

          <p>Regardless of the reaction I have to shame, I try to resolve it by following this path. While one should try to live their life with humility, I think the process of learning from and overcoming shame is far more nuanced than that of wanton humility.</p>
