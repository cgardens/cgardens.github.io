        <div id="entrytitle"> </br>TMI: A Self-Indulgent Analysis of How I Think</div>
        <div id="date"> 10/26/2014 </div>
        <div class="statement">
          <p>The biggest challenge for me in Phase 0 has been the GPSs. They have gone quite well overall, but there is something about the prospect of collaborating with someone while being observed that I find very uncomfortable. This has always been the case for me as far back as my directing days. It's weird, because I don't mind being observed--I've done enough acting that doing stuff in front of people is pretty comfortable--and I really enjoy collaborative projects. I should also note that I rather look forward to the regulard pairings.</p>

          <p>I'm going to go ahead and talk about Gregorc Thinking and see if that helps address the aforementioned problem. Gregorc apparently didn't know what to do with me, because while I am certainly not a Concrete Sequential thinker, I am scored 10 points in Abstract Sequential but then 9 points in Abstract Random and Concrete Random. Now, I don't know quite enough about their determination rubric to know if 1 point is a signficant difference or not, but to my layman's eye, it's not.</p>

          <p>Let me address Abstract Sequential (AS) first, and then I'll hit the uncertainty-ness of these results. When I read the description for AS it seemed pretty on target. I like to tackle a project alone first, and then bring in experts and collaborate with a team. It's difficult for me to make a decision before I think that I have enough information. And yes, when I am passionate about something, I need to check myself from trying taking over.</p>

          <p>The lesson I take out of this analysis for DBC, is that I really need to be on top of my game with reading material and glancing at problems on my own first. I'm going to try to do this in small ways though. For example on the first GPS, I did not look at the challenge ahead of time, and so I felt somewhat overwhelmed trying to respond to my pair, read the challenge, feel comfortable in an approach and being observed all at once--the reality though is that the challenge itself was not all that difficult and I was in fact probably marginally stronger on the GPS 1 material than that of GPS 2. But GPS 2, I cheated. I glanced glanced at the challenge ahead of time, but I mean glanced--I don't think I was on the page for more than 60 seconds. I check out what Flockdraw was and saw that the challenges were totally doable. Just that tiny bit of preparation made me so much more comfortable going into the pairing. Because I wasn't trying to soak in the material, I was able to focus more on my pair and how we could work together. I think in practice for the rest of DBC it's just a matter of reading whatever textbook/materials ahead of time. Just glancing at stuff (again less than 5 minutes of persual) before I get on the bus in the morning so it can digest in my head. I'm confident that I can kick ass at all of this material, but will feel a lot better doing it this way.</p>

          <p>In the context of a growth mindset, I think this means that I need to focus in on what I goals I'm looking to acheive at DBC, so that I'm not looking around and thinking, "so and so is better at this than I am," but "so and so is better at this than I am and I can learn from them to acheive my own goals and they can learn from me as well." While I need to start the learning process by myself and need to set my own goals, there is so much I can learn from my peers. What an exciting prospect!</p>

          <p>Okay, so then how do Abstract Random (AR) and Concrete Random (CR) fit into the picture? I think the reality is that I certainly have important traits associated with both, reaping both the pros and cons of each thinking style. I have become used to collaborating in groups and value relationships therein as the key to their success. I do sometimes have trouble working with people that I perceive as unfriendly. These are both trais of the AR style. As for CR I think a little competition is fun, and as I mentioned above, really like the chance to tackle something by myself first just to get an idea of the challenge, but not necessarily with the expectation that I will solve it alone. This approach is also indicative of being willing to experiment. I also don't terribly like closing off options/systems (this is the equivelent of a Perceiving as opposed to a Judgmental type in Meyers-Brigg). I also hate filing... which I'm pretty sure is characterstic of CR (not liking to keep detailed records).</p>

          <p>So now I've listed all of these attributes, some of which seem mutually exclusive. But I do think this analysis paints the fullest picture of who I am and that is someone who prides themselves on being extremely adaptable when approaching a problem. From directing and working in general management for theatre, I learned that every problem is different and there is no one approach that is a solve-all. The successful manager/director/problem-solver is the person who can adapt to the needs of each projects. The wants of whatever group they're a part of. Like I said, I'm somewhat accustomed to working in a leadership role on projects, but can step down and take orders too.</p>

          <p>Does this explain my anxiety over GPSs? I think so. Having someone observe me when I am tackling a problem for the first time feels like they are looking for the answers from the get go, while I know that I don't have those answers and need to take time to experiment and work with my partner first before the observer is going to see anything wortwhile in terms of product. On top of that adapting to an environment when there is someone outside of it observing you, still seems uncanny. Maybe the observer can see through the ruse. I don't have an answer to this last bit yet. That said, I do think this post has helped shine some light on my anxiety and helped me put together a plan that will allow me to get the most out of learning at DBC.</p>
