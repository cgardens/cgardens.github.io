        <div id="entrytitle"> </br>In Want of a Patent </div>
        <div id="date"> 11/02/2014 </div>
        <div class="statement">
          <p>Patent law and practice in the tech industry has grown in controversy over the years. Before I go any further, I should note that I don't presume to take a "side" on this topic, but, rather, am interested in reviewing a couple of the conflicts and headlines that we've seen in the last couple years. I will, however, attempt to point out to you that while these patent issues are more pressing than ever, they are a part of a long legacy of intellectual property infringement debate. Hopefully this post will inspire you to do your own historical research to inform your own opinion on this topic.</p>

          <p>As you cull through the headlines, the there are two major themes that arise. The first: Small entrepreneur creates something fantastic, but then big business figures it out and patents it first or big business has already patented it with a sweeping and technically vacant claim. This type of story should sound familiar however. Some of you might remember the late-night advertisement from the early two thousands claiming to help entrepreneurs get patents--particularly memorable was the woman who asserted that she had designed the Swiffer long before Proctor &amp; Gamble.</p>

          <p>Conflicting claims like these get ugly, especially for the little guy who doesn't have the arsenal of lawyers or the coffers to survive a pitched legal battle. A NY Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/08/technology/patent-wars-among-tech-giants-can-stifle-competition.html?pagewanted=all">article</a> covers just such a case where Vlingo, a small company developing computer voice recognition software, was targeted by larger firm Nuance who claimed that Vlingo was infringing on one of their patents. While Vlingo won the first of 6 lawsuits filed against them clearing them of infrigement. After that first battle, they didn't have the money to fight the other 5 suits and the owner was leveraged into selling his company to Nuance. Were they legitimate claims? Well we'll never know. Similarly, we'll never know  if the lady from the advertisement really did design the world's first Swiffer.</p>

          <p>Further difficulty arises for the "little guy" because many large corporations have adapted, to quote Steve Jobs regarding the development of the iPhone, "weâ€™re going to patent it all" policy. Because of budding patent wars, large companies get ahead of the game by utilizing large legal staffs dedicated to patenting any idea that comes out of the company, even if it's not a product they actually plan to develop. Even this mentality is not all that disimilar to the early days of automobiles with Henry Ford and Thomas Edison trying to patent anything they could think of. There are, however, persuasive arguments to be made that this "spamming" of patents, if you will, tend towards patents that contain little technical underpinning--again an argument that dates back centuries. Depending on your side in this debate you might call these types of patents "good" or "bad." I think, however, it is fair to say that the single entrepreneur struggles to compete with large corporate batteries of lawyers--again a fact that you might feel strongly about one way or another.</p>

          <p>The second major theme you find is conflict between large corporations--both armed to the teeth with these aforementioned lawyers. These conflicts essentially arise out of the same issues we've already addressed. Who had the idea first? Is code too similar? Is that patent technically rigorous? Even if the idea is similar are they actually that similar technically? In many ways this story refrains so many years of patent strife. Think the telephone, the radio, etc.</p>

          <p>This post only scratches the surface of what has become a conflict that costs billions in legal fees annually. There has been controversy surrounding patent law since its conception in Venice in the 15th Century--not to mention the international enforcement thereof. And I can only guess that patent law was breathed into existence in Renaissance Italy because someone was arguing over who invented something first. That is not to say there is not a problem that needs fixing or that it has not gotten worse in recent decades. But when one attempts to solve the issue, he or she should appreciate the centuries of history that have built up to this conflagration in the tech world. This problem is not a 21st Century issue but one that is hundreds of years old.</p>
