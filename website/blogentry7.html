        <div id="entrytitle"> </br>In Want of a Patent </div>
        <div id="date"> 11/02/2014 </div>
        <div class="statement">
          <p>Patent law and practice in the tech industry has grown in controversy over the years. Before I go any further, I should note that I don't presume to take a "side" on this topic, but, rather, am interested in reviewing a couple of the conflicts and headlines that we've seen in the last couple years and how they fit into the history of the issue. Hopefully this post will provide my reader with a compilation of some useful information, but in the famous defense of Mad Men's Don Draper, "I don't vote." I will throughout this post try to point out that these issues, while perhaps more prevalent now in tech than in other industries before it, are part of a long history of patent conflicts that stretch back for centuries.</p>

          <p>In a general sense, the battlefield of this conflict is already well trodden and in some ways reenacts the greatest battles between "small creator" and "big business" as well as conflicts between "big businesses" as well. So though the technology everyone is fighting over is new, we're certainly buying into some old tropes that certainly pre-date electricity.</p>

          <p>As you cull through the headlines, the there are two major themes that arise. Small entrepreneur creates something fantastic, but then big business figures it out and patents it first or big business has already patented it with a sweeping and technically vacant claim. Again, this is a story we've heard before. Some of you might remember the late-night advertisement from the early two thousands claiming to help entrepreneurs get patents--particularly memorable was the woman who asserted that she had designed the Swiffer long before Proctor & Gamble.</p>

          <p>Conflicting claims like these get ugly, especially for the little guy who doesn't have the arsenal of lawyers or the coffers to survive a pitched legal battle. A NY Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/08/technology/patent-wars-among-tech-giants-can-stifle-competition.html?pagewanted=all">article</a> covers just such a case where Vlingo, a small company developing computer voice recognition software, was targeted by larger firm Nuance who claimed that Vlingo was infringing on one of their patents. While Vlingo won the first of 6 lawsuits filed against them clearing them of infrigement, after that first battle, they didn't have the money to fight the other 5 and the owner was leveraged into selling his company to Nuance. Were they legitimate claims? Well we'll never know. Similarly, we'll neverknow  if the lady from the advertisement really did design the world's first Swiffer.</p>

          <p>Further difficulty arises for the "little guy" because many large corporations have adapted, to quote Steve Jobs regarding the development of the iPhone, "weâ€™re going to patent it all" policy. Because of budding patent wars, large companies utilize large legal staffs to patent any idea they have, even if it's not a product they actually plan to develop. This instance of patenting even resembles some of the old world corporate patenting mentality. There are, however, solid arguments to be made that certain patents are filed without sufficient technical support associated--again an argument that dates back centuries.</p>

          <p>The second major theme you find is conflict between large corporations--both armed to the teeth with lawyers. These conflicts essentially arise out of the same issues we're already addressed. Who had the idea first? Is code too similar? Does this idea that was patented actually relate to this other firm's technical idea? In many ways this story refrains so many years of patent strife. Let's not forget all of the bizarre patent baboonery that went on around Nikola Tesla's work.</p>

          <p>This post only scratches the surface of what has become a conflict that costs billions in legal fees annually. While I am no lawyer and am hesitant to cast in my lot with any player, I think it is important to realize that this problem is not new. There has been controversy surrounding patent law since its conception in Venice in the 15th Century. And I can only guess that patent law was breathed into existence in Renaissance Italy because someone was arguing who invented something first. That is not to say there is not a problem that needs fixing or that it has not gotten worse in recent decades. But when one attempts to solve the issue, he or she should appreciate the centuries of history that have built up to this conflagration in the tech world. This problem is not a 21st Century issue but one that is hundreds of years old.</p>
