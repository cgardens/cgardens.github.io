        <div class="statement">
          <p>So git is really nifty for your everyday imbecile like me. You know the moment after editing a paper for hours and you hit "save" as opposed to "save as" and suddenly you've saved over the original which had info you needed... NEVER TO BE FOUND AGAIN!!! "OH F***!" Well that's version control. Instead of the "oh f***" moment, it lets you backtrack to any of the "saves" (or in git jargin: "commits"). Even better, when you and your friend are working the same file stored online and you accidentally overwrite his work, you can backtrack--the downside is that your friend will have a log that you were the guy to overwrite all his hard work. But while your friend will certainly face palm, at least he didn't lose anything--other than quite a bit of respect for you. In fact, it's pretty fantastic in that it allows multiple people to work on the same file and then merge those changes back together in a well-documented way so when people realize your code is buggy they can all point at you as opposed to a long and profane game of "Who Dun' It?"</p>

          <p>Incompetence aside, the collaborative and editing processes are messy. New drafts, multiple users, changes that are half done, etc. Git brings order to the chaos of all of this by logging and tracking all these changes.</p>

          <p>Github, an online platform that makes use of git, is the logical expansion of the functionality behind version control. Instead of sharing one file on your hard drive, the file is online and multiple users can access and change it as long as they have an internet connection.</p>
