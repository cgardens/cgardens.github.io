        <div id="entrytitle"> </br>OOP v FP </div>
        <div id="date"> 11/16/2014 </div>
        <div class="statement">
          <p>The debate between Functional Programming (FP) and Objected-Oriented Programming (OOP) an underground war that rages unbeknownst to most. But what are these parties really fighting for? As an innocent bystander, I’ll try to fill you in on what each side means and let you decide with whom you will fight.</p>

          <p>OOPs is built a round the paradigm of building objects that store “data” and methods close together—i.e. in the same objects. FP on the other hand centers on a series of methods that take inputs and outputs.</p>

          <p>One prevailing theory is that OOP is a valuable way to design large programs for clients, because it focuses on breaking down code into freestanding objects. Thus, when something is changed in one part of the code, the rest of the program still works.</p>

          <p>There are those in support of FP who will argue that encapsulated in methods, FP is similarly versatile. </p>

          <p>Another consideration, of course, is what language you’re coding in and what you’re actually trying to do. For mathematics and manipulating large data sets, keeping data separate from methods seems to be somewhat standard—a very FP way of doing things.</p>

          <p>There are certainly pros and cons to each, and as with all things important, it depends on what you’re doing and your personal preference when you choose to embark using one or the other.</p>
