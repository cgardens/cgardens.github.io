        <div id="entrytitle"> </br>IMPOSTER! </div>
        <div id="date"> 11/16/2014 </div>
        <div class="statement">
          <p>I’ve certainly felt like an imposter, whether it was in auditions, job interviews, or any number of instances when I was surrounded by highly accomplished people. The trigger for me is that I get stuck comparing my accomplishments to those of others and then become insecure. In response, I usually become very quiet and deflect with humor.

          <p>In reading up a little more on Imposter Syndrome and ways to counteract it, I fixated on the “cease comparisons” approach. In fact, one of the resolutions I made coming into DBC, was to set my own goals and not get bogged down in other people’s accomplishments relative to my own. Working in a group is galvanizing, and I truly believe that learning with others allows you to understand a topic so much more thoroughly. Whether it’s taking the time to understand another person’s point of view, helping someone else out—if you can explain it that means you’re one step closer to being a master of it, getting to ask other people questions, and of course being motivated by the general excitement of those around you.

          <p>The trouble is when this turns from friendly competition into an irrational desire to be as good as everyone around you at everything. Everyone is better at something than you are, and trying to chase everyone up to being the best at everything is not only obnoxious but self-defeating, as you cannot succeed.

          <p>Thus coming into DBC, I am excited to say that I have created my own set of goals to drive me through this experience, so that I can maximize what I can learn from DBC and my fellow boots.
