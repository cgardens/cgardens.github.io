          <p>If you&#39;re learning a new programming language, you have probably heard, at least peripherally, of recursion. It is often referred to as a frightening coding technique that you have not learned yet. Today&#39;s the day. We&#39;re going to demystify the &#34;R-word.&#34;</p>

          <p>If you are working in a dynamic programming language Ruby, Python, JavaScript, etc. recursion is very similar looping. An example will make this go a lot faster.</p>

          <p>Let&#39;s start by building a function that that evaluates the value of a number raised to an exponent. We will first do this using a loop. Hopefully you are already familiar with loops--you may have already created such a function for one class or another. (I&#39;ll be working in Ruby)</p>

          <span class="code">
            def exp1(base, exponent)
              total = 1
              while exponent > 0
                total *= base
                exponent -= 1
              end
              return total
            end

          p exp1(2,3)
          => 8
          </span>

          <p>This method uses a loop to keep multiply the base times itself n times where n is the value of the exponent. Pretty simple.</p>

          <p>Now we can use recursion to do the same thing! Let&#39;s throw down the code and then talk about it.</p>

          <span class="code">
            def exp2(base,exponent)
              if exponent == 0
                return 1
              else
                return base * exp2(base, exponent -1)
              end
            end

            p exp2(2,3)
            => 8
          </span>

          <p>This multiplies base times itself n times where n is the value of the exponent, just like the previous function. The difference is that instead of using a loop, every time it needs to multiply by the base, it calls itself again with the same base but the exponent minus one. Doesn&#39;t make sense yet? That&#39;s okay. I&#39;ll walk you through step by step.</p>

          <ol>
            <li>We call exp2 with a base of 2 and exponent of 3, which is the same 2^3 if you remember your algebra classes.</li>
            <li>Exponent doesn&#39;t equal 0, so it goes to the else branch of the if statement where it multiplies 2 * exp2(2, 2).</li>

            <li>When we call exp2(2,2), exponent doesn&#39;t equal 0, so it goes to the else branch of the if statement where it multiplies 2 * exp2(2,1).</li>

            <li>When we call exp2(2,2), exponent doesn&#39;t equal 0, so it goes to the else branch of the if statement where it multiplies 2 * exp2(2,0).</li>

            <li>When we call exp2(2,0), exponent equals 0, so it returns 1.</li>

            <li>Now we need to unwrap it all.</li>

            <li>Since exp2(2,0) returned 1, that means the else branch of exp2(2,1) looks like this: 2 * 1 (because exp2(2,0) evaluated to 1 in step 5). This equals 2.</li>

            <li>Since exp2(2,1) returned 2, that means the else branch of exp2(2,2) looks like this: <li>2 * 2 (because exp2(2,1) evaluated to 2 in the previous step). This equals 4.</li>

            <li>Since exp2(2,2) returned 4, that means the else branch of exp2(2,3) look like this: 2 * 4 (because exp2(2,2) evaluated to 4 in the previous step). This equals 8. Thus exp2(2,3) evaluates to 8!</li>
          </ol>

          <p>With recursion, first, you are stacking calls of the function on top of each other. Once you get to the point where you have stacked them all, you need to work your way all the way down by evaluating each function in order using the return of the instance of the function on top of it. So you stack them all up, but then pull each one off until you&#39;re back down to the original.</p>

          <p>Think of it like stacking plates. You put down one plate, then another, then another. To get to the bottom plate you need to take off the top plate, then the plate that is on top after you have removed the first plate. Then you are at the bottom plate.</p>

          <p>The three basic parts of a recursive function are:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>1.  Base Case: A condition that stops the recursion.<br>
            (ex. In our example that was return 1 exponent equaled 0)</li>
            <li>2.  A step towards base case.<br>
            (ex. In our example that was subtracting 1 from exponent each time we recursed)</li>
            <li>3.  Recursive Call: A call to itself.<br>
            (ex. In our example that was calling exp2 again)</li>
          </ol>

          <p>Why Recursion?</p>

          <p>In dynamic languages such a Ruby, recursion is usually less preferable next to other forms of iteration built into the language like looping, etc. for two main reasons: 1) Recursion is generally slower than iteration in these languages 2) Because a program allocates a certain amount of memory to a stack, a recursion might require more than that allocated memory causing a stack overflow. Boom. In static programming languages, where the aforementioned iterations are not built in, recursion might be the only way to achieve your task, in which case they are incredibly valuable.</p>
