Taking off the Dinner Suit; Putting on the Apron

10/12/2014

I chose DBC, because it is an opportunity where there is no diminishing returns on added effort in. The same is true of coding, but I think DBC understands that better than any other program, and modifies its curriculum to take advantage of that. Shereef's kitchen analogy is particularly inspirational, because I want to be a part of a place that doesn't say, "Great! You paid X. Here's what we think is X worth of value." I want a place that says, "What do you have to put in? Because for each unit of 'more' you can give us, we're going to help you acheive your goals." In short, I'm taking off my dinner suit and putting on my apron. That's DBC.

Am I scared that I might not be good enough? Sure, but that's not going to help me succeed. The only answer can be: I CAN DO THIS! I am humbled by the amount of learning I am taking on in this short period of time and know that I come in knowing little. But only I can change that with the help of DBC.

Phase 0 particularly appeals to me, because it gives me time to front load as much knowledge as I can. I want to absorb enough now so that I can come into DBC and jam with my cohort! And I know that jam and these people will be a part of my life now and hereinafter.
