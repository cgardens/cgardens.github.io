           <p>While I have worked on many collaborative projects, pairing is really unique in that the collaboration is happening on the same screen on the same piece of code. Now that I&#39;m used to it though, I am impressed by its value, whether its brainstorming ideas, having a second set of eyes to check code, etc. It really can open up a whole new level of problem-solving. </p>

          <p>The best pairing, I&#39;ve seen so far is that where the &#34;roles&#34; seem effortless. In the very beginning of the process we were bonked over the head with a somewhat rigid idea of what a Navigator (the overseer and guide of the code) and a Driver (the poor bastard doing the typing while also adding feedback&hellip; sorta) were. And while I understand that we had to start somewhere, and that was really as good a place as any, the most successful pairing sessions I&#39;ve had are those in which we assigned the roles, but there was a line of communication that transcended them. With that came the freedom to switch roles for a second if it made sense. This rigid system can give way to a really vibrant collaboration, but you have to start with the system to guarantee that you understand your partners needs.</p>

          <p>The pairings that feel less successful are those in which you feel confined in whatever role to which you&#39;ve been assigned. Suddenly you&#39;re withholding information, not maliciously, but because that&#39;s not your role. That&#39;s not really constructive in a two-person collaboration. Otherwise if that &#34;transcendent&#34; communication isn&#39;t there, then you might become lost. </p>

          <p>A great discussion we had in our accountability group today was about when you are in a pairing and you need to step away from the code. Was it appropriate to in the pairing? Would it offend your pair? We ultimately agreed that if you need a second away from the code or a moment of silence, youâ€™ve got to ask for it&#8212;politely of course. </p>

          <p>The feedback aspect thus far seems watered down. I have no delusions that I am the perfect pair, but all of my feedback has been very &#34;nice.&#34; I&#39;ve started trying to do 5 minutes of feedback at the end of pairing sessions, because I feel like that leads to a more honest and ACTIONABLE conversation. The important thing with feedback is to know that it is a gift offered to help you&#8212;not a barb. </p>

          <p>Giving feedback has been relatively comfortable for me, but I definitely feel myself soft-selling it because I don&#39;t want to offend people that I barely know. I think that&#39;s probably fine for now and will improve as these relationships progress. Like I mentioned, I&#39;ve started to rely on more in person feedback/check&#8211;ins at the end of pairings as I think I can usually give more actionable feedback in the context of a conversation than a few hundred characters. Of course it&#39;s nice to also type it out later in the feedbackinator as a nice summary of your discussion.</p>
