          <p>Building a &#34;professional&#34; website has been the most challenging part of Phase 0 for me. The first time I copped out a bit by just making it spaceship themed. Which was fun, but certainly not professional. I definitely fall into the category of person who can see and discuss design, but developing it from scratch myself was excruciating. I don&#39;t know what colors and shapes to put together to make &#34;professional.&#34; I also have a lack of content, which makes it harder to put together. I think building a website that sold hyper drives would actually be easier.</p>

          <p>I held myself to not using any frameworks, bootstrap, Jekyll, etc this time around. This choice made the process longer, but ultimately forced my to spend many hours working with HTML and CSS, which was time well spent, even if it doesn&#39;t feel like I have a lot to show for it. Im ultimately pleased with the final product as a temporary measure. As I add more content, I think it will really start to encapsulate me. After DBC, I think I&#39;m going to have to go back and use a framework to make it look really tight. At the same time, I like having a website that I know how every bit of it works, because I built it myself. Especially for a junior web developer, that seems valuable as I plan to add/integrate what I learn into the website so that it can be an attractive portfolio to potential employers. But that is still a few releases down the line...</p>
