        <p>Ruby v. Javascript:<br/> Which Should You Learn First?
        <div id="date"> 11/23/2014 </div></p>
        <div id="description">
          <p> <a href="../blog-index.html">back to blog index</a> </p>

          <p>Like any topic that can be explored on the Internet, there numerous and strong opinions about the pro and cons of each language, specifically in regard to which to learn first. While the research of this post started as an exploration in the differences in documentation between the two, I decided this more general debate about which to learn first was more interesting.</p>

          <p>The most prevalent argument that I have come across on &#39;Pro JS&#39; sites is that JS is a burgeoning language because it now handles both backend and frontend on so many websites and web applications. There is a demand for those who know the language, and it seems like that demand will continue to grow as the uses and popularity of JS increase.</p>

          <p>On the flip side, Ruby and Rails are both industry mainstays, and the demand for Ruby programmers is high. At the entry level, it appears to me that companies are looking for someone who has a dynamic grasp of the core elements of programming as well as a cache of other skills (vision, people skills, organizational, etc) to make them valuable to their team. What research I have done, leads me to believe that whatever language you learn first has little bearing on your long-term career. Also after you&#39;ve mastered the basics you&#39;ll be looking for something entry-level, where employers are more interested that you can prove proficiency in a language along with the other skills I&#39;ve mentioned as opposed to specific knowledge of one language--at this level you are not a master of any language and training yourself up in another language should be a swift process. Thus, learning a specific language in order to find a job seems to be putting the cart before the horse, especially when there are other qualities to these languages that might better and more quickly allow you to grasp key concepts and take steps towards mastery.</p>

          <p>Another argument I&#39;ve encountered that is pro-JS is that setup is easier because you encounter and can start using JS in whatever web browser you currently use. Ruby on the other hand requires some installation--though there are enough guides online to make this a seamless process in my opinion.</p>

          <p>In favor of Ruby, is that syntactically, it is much more readable than JS. It also incorporates less punctuation, which might be overwhelming for a beginner.  Ruby&#39;s syntactic sugar really does aid in the transition from civilian thinking to thinking like a programmer--arguably the most important objective in learning a to code. </p>

          <p>Ruby, while being more readable and less punctuated, is not a terribly forgiving language. Some might argue that that is a con if you&#39;re a beginner, but I would posit that JS&#39;s forgiveness actually promotes a lot of bad habits. Because JS works so hard to make sense of your code--even if it does not interpret it the way you intended--it allows you to get a way with writing messy or wrong code. The problem is you don&#39;t know because JS won&#39;t shoot back an error, and so if you&#39;re a beginner, it&#39;s much harder to self-regulate your mistakes, leaving you either confused as to why something isn&#39;t working or unaware that your code isn&#39;t working. A good example are semicolons in JS. You&#39;re supposed to have them, but often your code will run fine without them, except when it doesn&#39;t, which can lead to endless confusion over a semicolon! Yuck. Ruby on the other hand, doesn&#39;t do as much to make up for wrong code, and when it encounters it gives you an informative error message.</p>

          <p>Overall, they are both popular and dynamic object-oriented languages. While I am slightly biased insofar as I am learning Ruby first, supplemented by only a little JS, I don&#39;t think there is a wrong answer in which language to pick. I think that Ruby is less intimidating to someone who has never looked at code and forces you to write better code from the beginning. Thus, I think it is the best candidate for helping you actually learn your first language. On the flip side, if you pursue web development you will have to work with JS at some point and it has many other merits not enumerated in this post. </p>

          <p>The most persuasive argument that I&#39;ve read is: Once you choose a language, see it through. I think there is value to dabbling in other languages as you focus on one, but for the most part, you are going to learn valuable programming concepts by pushing deeper into one language than by simply learning the basics in each.</p>

          <p>Whatever your decision... Good luck!</p>
